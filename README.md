🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction – Machine Learning Web App

This is a simple and interactive Streamlit web application that predicts whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster based on certain input features.
The model used in this app is trained on the Titanic dataset (commonly used in Kaggle ML competitions).

📌 Features

User-friendly UI built using Streamlit

Takes passenger inputs such as:

Passenger Class

Sex

Age

Number of Siblings/Spouses

Number of Parents/Children

Ticket Fare

Uses a pre-trained Machine Learning model (titanic_model.pkl) to predict survival

Displays result clearly:

✅ Survived

❌ Not Survived
